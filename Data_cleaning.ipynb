However, I have noticed slight weight gain (about 5 pounds), and have had severely tender breasts. Sometimes it will last over 1 month and they are sore to the point that moving my arms makes me cringe. The only other major side effect has been frequent bleeding and much heavier periods than usual.  I normally have a fairly light, short period (2 days normal bleeding, 1-2 of spotting). But there have been two occasions since starting Lyza in which I have woken up in a pool of blood on the bed because the bleeding is so heavy and unexpected. There has been some bloating as well, but I'm not sure if that is due to the pill because I had the same issue with Mirena. I have my suspicions about ovarian cysts, so that could be causing the bloating, breast tenderness, and abnormal bleeding. I rated ease of use as one star because it has been very difficult for me to remember to take the pill on time even though I set an alarm on my phone. However, it is still effective because I haven't gotten pregnant yet. I just make sure to use back up protection, or abstain for 3 days after taking a pill late.</td>\n",

As soon as the patch was gone, I wanted cigarettes, and Wellbutrin worked as intended by making them taste bad, but I wanted them just the same.\\n\\nThis on the other hand is just purely God sent.  My first few days of quitting were riddled with tough spots, because I saw myself as more of a habbit smoker, as opposed to nicotene craving, thus situations which normally constituted smoking, and the lack thereof, were troublesome.  But I must say, as my shining moment thus far.  I woke up this morning and made it about an hour and a half without even thinking about a cigarette, and even then it wasn't in a wanting sense, it was just a random thought.  For anyone who needs proof it works, I am it.  I had tried the other methods, but this one works!\\n\\nDid have some leg cramps and general bodyache the first few days though, but I would have taken a brain annurism to feel like I do now, free of those nasty cigarettes forever!\\n\\nYou can do it!</td>\n",

I was a month or more of psychological hell going through withdrawal, and I had never experienced anything like it, and hope to never do so again. I also have kidney problems now, that I can only attribute to this medication. I'd rather keep smoking and risk dying of cancer, than destroy my kidneys by ever taking it again, or end up killing myself. I recommend that if you take this, tell your friends, family and co-workers you are on it, and to ask them to note changes in your mood or behavior that you may not be aware of yourself while on it, or after discontinuing it. I wish I had told people, so perhaps someone could have prevented the hell I went through taking it, as it was so not worth it.

I have been quit a year and a half BUT the difference this time is I could care less about smoking, I can't believe I EVER smoked and I have zero desire to ever smoke again. It has been a wonderful miracle for me. I would like to note I started exercising (not overly, maybe 30 min. 3x a week on elliptical) to offset any depression, I had no depression. Before when I quit I was distraught. I took Chantix for a little under 6 mos. b/c I wanted to make sure I was quit forever. And I am! My counselor suggested Chantix to me.

In 12 days I went from 40-45/day to zero.  I have very little, if any real cravings .. The side effects of the drug itself includes vivid and often bizarre dreams, often good for a laugh or two the following day.  The stomach upset is easily addressed by taking the medication with a real meal in the morning and the same in the evening.  Have had no bad effects of Chantix after the initial \"almost 2 weeks\" and I'm very pleased with the results so far.</td>\n",

My only complaint is that I had severe nausea after taking the second pill each day so I cut back to just taking the morning pill.  I do have dreams but they're not as vivid since I only take one pill a day.  I go through a bit more withdrawal not taking the recommended dose, but it's tolerable.  I'll just continue taking the pills until the prescription runs out, even if I'm taking them longer than the prescribed time.  \\n\\nAlot of people have commented on being constipated with this pill.  I've quit smoking several times before and constipation is part of it.  To avoid this I have a slimfast shake in the morning with about 4 tbsp of ground flax and 3 tbsp of hemp mixed into it.  Not only does it keep the plumbing working in top form, it's very filling.  I've been smoke free since October 27 and feel great!</td>\n",

I have anxiety problems and I had recently gotten off Lexapro and found that chantix alone made my anxiety worse. This time I am taking my lexapro with it and it hasn't affected my anxiety. I do have strange and vivid dreams, but nothing scary. I've started talking in my sleep as well. It definitely helps with the cravings. I still get them but I can easily occupy myself until they go away. But these seem like small side effects to deal with when I think of the greater benefits of being a non-smoker!!</td>\n",

After a couple months I stopped getting a period. I just had a period every few months or it was just spotting for that period.  Either way I like not getting a period so thatâ??s a plus w this pill. No side effects.

I eat really healthy and I'm very active but had so much bloating and a fair amount of weight gain. I had less cramping but 7 days of heavy bleeding. The nausea was unbearable most of the time. While this pill was effective, the side effects were so horrible that I quit taking it. My husband and I decided one more baby and then sterilization. No more pills!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "21      My OB/GYN placed me on this pill because I was at risk for a stroke while being on estrogen birth controls. I have been taking this medication for 2 months with no side effects: migraines have stopped, no acne, no mood swings, no weight gain, no spotting, and sex drive is still intact. The first month of taking this pill my period was extremely light (almost nonexistant) and lasted only two days. This month I didn't have a period and took a pregnancy test, it was negative. I read reviews that this is normal while taking this pill... Not sure if I like this factor? All in all, i'm pretty pleased with this birth control. Please note that this is a progestin only pill and it is important to take at it at the same time daily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "22      I started taking Lyza birth control because the combined pill I was on previously (Aubra) was causing me to get migraines. Since I've been on Lyza I have noticed that I have been VERY bloated. Also I have never had back acne before and now I do, but it is very mild. Not to mention I have had one period since I have been on this pill. I got a period after the first month and I have taken several pregnancy tests that all come up negative. Also...I have been totally moody. I constantly think my period is coming, but it never does.

       "23      I have been using this birth control for over a year and I have not had any side effects. I feel great and continue to workout and eat very clean. I doubt that a pill can cause someone to fill bloated or gain weight...I would rethink what people are eating because food is a major factor for  a lot of side effects. Eat clean and workout and you will be fine :) it has worked for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "24      I switched from the Mirena to Lyza and the relief from horrendous cramps was amazing and instantaneous. However, I have noticed slight weight gain (about 5 pounds), and have had severely tender breasts. Sometimes it will last over 1 month and they are sore to the point that moving my arms makes me cringe. The only other major side effect has been frequent bleeding and much heavier periods than usual.  I normally have a fairly light, short period (2 days normal bleeding, 1-2 of spotting). But there have been two occasions since starting Lyza in which I have woken up in a pool of blood on the bed because the bleeding is so heavy and unexpected. There has been some bloating as well, but I'm not sure if that is due to the pill because I had the same issue with Mirena. I have my suspicions about ovarian cysts, so that could be causing the bloating, breast tenderness, and abnormal bleeding. I rated ease of use as one star because it has been very difficult for me to remember to take the pill on time even though I set an alarm on my phone. However, it is still effective because I haven't gotten pregnant yet. I just make sure to use back up protection, or abstain for 3 days after taking a pill late.                               \n",

       "362778  Unbeleiveable!  It is as though cigarettes never existed!  I am now in week 2 of the dosage and I have to say it is like a miracle.  I tried the patches, and the Wellbutrin to no avail.  As soon as the patch was gone, I wanted cigarettes, and Wellbutrin worked as intended by making them taste bad, but I wanted them just the same.\\n\\nThis on the other hand is just purely God sent.  My first few days of quitting were riddled with tough spots, because I saw myself as more of a habbit smoker, as opposed to nicotene craving, thus situations which normally constituted smoking, and the lack thereof, were troublesome.  But I must say, as my shining moment thus far.  I woke up this morning and made it about an hour and a half without even thinking about a cigarette, and even then it wasn't in a wanting sense, it was just a random thought.  For anyone who needs proof it works, I am it.  I had tried the other methods, but this one works!\\n\\nDid have some leg cramps and general bodyache the first few days though, but I would have taken a brain annurism to feel like I do now, free of those nasty cigarettes forever!\\n\\nYou can do it!                                                                                                        \n",

       "362783  I smoked for 11 years, tried Chantix in May 2008 and quit completely after 8 weeks.  I had vivid dreams.  I also had intense stomach pain after taking a dose, but this only occurred if I did not eat beforehand.  I had a bought of severe depression several years ago, but had no psychological reactions to Chantix.  The medication is expensive if your insurance does not cover it, but it is well worth it--I am presently taking care of a loved-one who has lung cancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "362784  I took this for 6mos, and although I still didn't quit smoking, I cut back tremendously. However, the side effects are miserable (except for the vivid dreams, which I still miss having now!). I experienced severe depression and suicidal ideation, never attributing it to the drug while I was taking it. And this side effect worsened after I stopped taking it. I was a month or more of psychological hell going through withdrawal, and I had never experienced anything like it, and hope to never do so again. I also have kidney problems now, that I can only attribute to this medication. I'd rather keep smoking and risk dying of cancer, than destroy my kidneys by ever taking it again, or end up killing myself. I recommend that if you take this, tell your friends, family and co-workers you are on it, and to ask them to note changes in your mood or behavior that you may not be aware of yourself while on it, or after discontinuing it. I wish I had told people, so perhaps someone could have prevented the hell I went through taking it, as it was so not worth it. While I understand many people have had success, as far as I'm concerned, it was no wonder drug at all, and could have cost me my life much faster than smoking. Never again.   \n",
       "362785  I smoked for almost 20 years heavily, and had tried to quit many times before (once quit for 2.5yrs.) but always craved cigarrettes and was one puff from being hooked again. Chantix has been a miracle. I did have stomach ache with it so we halved my dosage, and I was able to quit within a few weeks completely, and had no adverse side effects. I have been quit a year and a half BUT the difference this time is I could care less about smoking, I can't believe I EVER smoked and I have zero desire to ever smoke again. It has been a wonderful miracle for me. I would like to note I started exercising (not overly, maybe 30 min. 3x a week on elliptical) to offset any depression, I had no depression. Before when I quit I was distraught. I took Chantix for a little under 6 mos. b/c I wanted to make sure I was quit forever. And I am! My counselor suggested Chantix to me. I also take Wellbutrin so that probably helped with no depression as well. Another great drug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

The first couple days that you don't smoke were hard for me, but got easier just as fast.  I found that if I took the Chantix exactly 12 hours apart, I had no problems (the first week you don't smoke).  I recommend this medication to anyone wanting to quit smoking.  It works!

       "362788  I am on my fourth week of Chantix. I do feel it is helping, but I feel as if I have an ulcer.  Only had one or two wild dreams.  The nausea has pretty much gone away now that my stomach is killing me all the time and I seem to have a headache even when I wake up in the morning.  Maybe it is the lack of the cigarette.  My father quit smoking years ago without drugs and was plagued by canker sores in his mouth for two solid years, so that is probably not the drug either.  I have a large one in my throat and one on the end of my tongue. Hoping all this is due to lack of nicotine and will go away.  Last weekend had the muscle and joint pain severely, thought I had the flu. Gonna try and stick it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "362789  If you or any family members have a history of depression, do not take this medication. (My mother and father both suffer from depression.) I have never had a problem with depression myself until I took Chantix. I did quit smoking but when I quit taking the Chantix, I fell into a deep and very scary depression. I started smoking again and am now on Lexapro for depression. I have been on Lexapro for a year now. I was the type of person that said I would not be affected by side effects, but I was wrong. During this I missed two weeks of work and temporarely moved back in with my mom because I never wanted to be alone. I couldn't sleep, couldn't focus on anything, didn't eat, lost 10 pounds. It was really bad. It was a complete waste of money and very terrible experience. If I could go back in time, I would have never taken Chantix. Please be careful and make sure you go back to your doctor right away if you start felling different at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "362791  I have been a chain smoker for 10 years. I tried everything and nothing could help me stop. I have now been completely smoke free for 2 months thanks to Chantix! The 1st couple of weeks were the toughest because I was severly short tempered and would go on a rampage for nothing, but I believe that was because of no cigaretts; It would have happened without the medicine! My family understood and supported my need to shut myself in my room for a while and it passed in about 2 weeks. And the vivid dreams are Great! Like going to cool, weird movies. Ever so often I may have a craving, but I can turn my thought to something else very easily and the craving will be gone! I Highly recommend Chantix if you really want to quit! It sure helped me! I feel much better now. My husband and my kids are very proud of me. As I am proud of myself and the Chantix! I send Thanks and my deepest gratitude for the developers of Chantix for helping me take control back in my life. Thank You!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "362793  Been smoking for 16 years, the last 3 years in excess of 2 packs/day.  Finally decided to try chantix since my prior attempts to quit has failed.  In 12 days I went from 40-45/day to zero.  I have very little, if any real cravings .. The side effects of the drug itself includes vivid and often bizarre dreams, often good for a laugh or two the following day.  The stomach upset is easily addressed by taking the medication with a real meal in the morning and the same in the evening.  Have had no bad effects of Chantix after the initial \"almost 2 weeks\" and I'm very pleased with the results so far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "362794  I've been on Chantix since mid September.  I love it!  My only complaint is that I had severe nausea after taking the second pill each day so I cut back to just taking the morning pill.  I do have dreams but they're not as vivid since I only take one pill a day.  I go through a bit more withdrawal not taking the recommended dose, but it's tolerable.  I'll just continue taking the pills until the prescription runs out, even if I'm taking them longer than the prescribed time.  \\n\\nAlot of people have commented on being constipated with this pill.  I've quit smoking several times before and constipation is part of it.  To avoid this I have a slimfast shake in the morning with about 4 tbsp of ground flax and 3 tbsp of hemp mixed into it.  Not only does it keep the plumbing working in top form, it's very filling.  I've been smoke free since October 27 and feel great!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "362796  this drug did work.  However I am now under the care of a psyciatrist because of extreme anxiety and loss of mental function.  The doc wont admit to any connection to Chantix even though Ive never had any problems before.  I am hoping to find others with these problems through other forums since this one is just a review. I was on this drug for six months, and have been off for three and the problems wont go away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "362799  I have tried the patch and quitting cold turkey before and this is by far the best way to quit smoking. I due deal with sickness after I have taken it, even if I take it with a full meal. But I have found that eating a light snack helps. I tried taking this medication a year ago but had to get off it. I have anxiety problems and I had recently gotten off Lexapro and found that chantix alone made my anxiety worse. This time I am taking my lexapro with it and it hasn't affected my anxiety. I do have strange and vivid dreams, but nothing scary. I've started talking in my sleep as well. It definitely helps with the cravings. I still get them but I can easily occupy myself until they go away. But these seem like small side effects to deal with when I think of the greater benefits of being a non-smoker!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

I have had some problems like getting sick after the meds but accually it helps because everytime I see a smoker or smell smoke I get sick, still want one but it offsets it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "362805  One year ago, I tried Chantix and had to stop taking it because I was so nauseous in the morning.  Three weeks ago I started it again and found that if I eat 10 minutes before taking the pill, I don't get nauseous at all.  I have been smoke free for two weeks and will never smoke again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
