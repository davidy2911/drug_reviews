      "I have been able to get off of a long time use of antidepressants using 5 htp. This has been life changing for me. I was depressed on the meds. Now I am getting well. I had actually been diagnosed with M S! I had so many side effects from the meds. Don't give up. The detox from the anti depressants was hard, but 5 htp helped tremendously.

I have used this drug for five years and after increasing the dose from one per day to three, experienced most of the listed side effects.  It is not worth the money to continue taking this drug for all the benefits I receive from it.  The benefits are very limited and the side affects are not worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1  \n",

      "My dr. gave me 10mg of lexapro, I took the first one last night before bed and suffered a ton of side effects nausea, insomnia, dry mouth, loss of appetite, hot flashes, chills, legs felt stiff, light headed, dizzy, dialated pupils, and horrible diarrhea. This was from one pill! I didn't sleep at all last night, I had to turn off all the lights and tv so I would overstimulate my eyes, and the diarrhea was still occuring up until a couple hours ago. The doctor suggests I half the dose, but I don't know if its worth going through this nightmare again. If you are sensative to medication I would say be careful about your dosage!\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1  \n",

      "After having my daughter in 8-2009 i decided to get back on a birth control regiment, pills were either making me gain weight or grow facial hair so my doctor suggested mirena. i stayed off the pills for a few months before having mirena inserted and managed to get down to my pre baby weight of 135, after having mirena put in i spotted for about two months before my body started adjusting to the implant. I noticed i started gaining weight, so i altered my diet to less meats more fresh raw vegies, and then the bf mentioned to me \"Honey, i think your gaining...\" Not long after the spotting started. Then i started getting cramping and pains, the final straw was when i felt like i was in labor, and went to the hospital. They couldnt deterine anything conclusively (small town hospital) so now i have to go to the doc's and see why. I know its the mirena, i;ve never had anything happen like this before. it makes you blimp up and get moody, the pains are random and severe (darn near crippling) and i've actually feared for my future. I just hope this thing doesnt leave me barren, i know my bf has his heart set on a son some day. Thanks mirena, you've really done the job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1  \n",

First few nights seen to kind of make me weak after i took it. 50 mgs was not enough after 1 wk I upped the dose to 100 mg. I will say that I do sleep better. I sometimes still wake up a little a little stressed, but over all it helps with both depression & anxiety. Non-additive, I'm a little leary of the SSRI's, if I can help it I'd rather stay on these. I do have vivid strange dreams, I think this is normal on this stuff. I'll let you folks know if I change meds.

      "I recently had this inserted and wanted to describe my experience.  I've never had children, but I do handle pain pretty well and I've had a miscarriage with horrendous cramps, so I thought I'd be ok.  While getting this inserted is about a 5 minute process, it was extremely painful.  This is how it goes - they insert the speculum (no pain at all).  They clean out your cervix (no pain).  They then clamp your cervix, which is like a little pinch but not really painful.  Next they measure your cervix, and that hurt a lot - take the worst cramps you've ever had and multiply by 10.  I breathed really heavily which helped, almost like breathing during labor (which I've only seen on TV or in movies).  Then they actually insert the IUD, and again the cramping is horrible.  Right after it was inserted, I became really nauseated, sweaty, and dizzy and thought I was going to vomit.  They brought me a little tray to throw up in if I had to do so.  They also brought me an ice pack and some apple juice.  My doctor said this is a normal response, and about 50% of women have it (there's a medical term for it, but I can't remember it).  After about 25 minutes, I started to feel better and all the bad side effects went away, except for the cramps.  I took some Advil right away and then went shopping, so the really terrible feelings didn't last.  I did have cramps for hours after the procedure, so I just kept taking Advil.  I haven't had my first real period since having this put in, so I don't know how heavy it will be or how the cramps will be.  But the experience itself was not pleasant at all.  It better be worth it in the long run!    1  \n",

Doctor started me on the amitrip a week ago so far i like it i also take celexa in the morning in combinatioin but the celexa 40mg isnt helping my anxiety started at 10mg worked my way up. I am 23 have told my doctor that I have been on xanax and klonipin for my PTSD and anxiety and it helped but he wants to explore more options before he gives me an addictive drug.

       "I have been able to get off of a long time use of antidepressants using 5 htp. This has been life changing for me. I was depressed on the meds. Now I am getting well. I had actually been diagnosed with M S! I had so many side effects from the meds. Don't give up. The detox from the anti depressants was hard, but 5 htp helped tremendously.

I have used this drug for five years and after increasing the dose from one per day to three, experienced most of the listed side effects.  It is not worth the money to continue taking this drug for all the benefits I receive from it.  The benefits are very limited and the side affects are not worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1  \n",

       "My dr. gave me 10mg of lexapro, I took the first one last night before bed and suffered a ton of side effects nausea, insomnia, dry mouth, loss of appetite, hot flashes, chills, legs felt stiff, light headed, dizzy, dialated pupils, and horrible diarrhea. This was from one pill! I didn't sleep at all last night, I had to turn off all the lights and tv so I would overstimulate my eyes, and the diarrhea was still occuring up until a couple hours ago. The doctor suggests I half the dose, but I don't know if its worth going through this nightmare again. If you are sensative to medication I would say be careful about your dosage!\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1  \n",

       "After having my daughter in 8-2009 i decided to get back on a birth control regiment, pills were either making me gain weight or grow facial hair so my doctor suggested mirena. i stayed off the pills for a few months before having mirena inserted and managed to get down to my pre baby weight of 135, after having mirena put in i spotted for about two months before my body started adjusting to the implant. I noticed i started gaining weight, so i altered my diet to less meats more fresh raw vegies, and then the bf mentioned to me \"Honey, i think your gaining...\" Not long after the spotting started. Then i started getting cramping and pains, the final straw was when i felt like i was in labor, and went to the hospital. They couldnt deterine anything conclusively (small town hospital) so now i have to go to the doc's and see why. I know its the mirena, i;ve never had anything happen like this before. it makes you blimp up and get moody, the pains are random and severe (darn near crippling) and i've actually feared for my future. I just hope this thing doesnt leave me barren, i know my bf has his heart set on a son some day. Thanks mirena, you've really done the job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1  \n",

First few nights seen to kind of make me weak after i took it. 50 mgs was not enough after 1 wk I upped the dose to 100 mg. I will say that I do sleep better. I sometimes still wake up a little a little stressed, but over all it helps with both depression & anxiety. Non-additive, I'm a little leary of the SSRI's, if I can help it I'd rather stay on these. I do have vivid strange dreams, I think this is normal on this stuff. I'll let you folks know if I change meds.

       "I recently had this inserted and wanted to describe my experience.  I've never had children, but I do handle pain pretty well and I've had a miscarriage with horrendous cramps, so I thought I'd be ok.  While getting this inserted is about a 5 minute process, it was extremely painful.  This is how it goes - they insert the speculum (no pain at all).  They clean out your cervix (no pain).  They then clamp your cervix, which is like a little pinch but not really painful.  Next they measure your cervix, and that hurt a lot - take the worst cramps you've ever had and multiply by 10.  I breathed really heavily which helped, almost like breathing during labor (which I've only seen on TV or in movies).  Then they actually insert the IUD, and again the cramping is horrible.  Right after it was inserted, I became really nauseated, sweaty, and dizzy and thought I was going to vomit.  They brought me a little tray to throw up in if I had to do so.  They also brought me an ice pack and some apple juice.  My doctor said this is a normal response, and about 50% of women have it (there's a medical term for it, but I can't remember it).  After about 25 minutes, I started to feel better and all the bad side effects went away, except for the cramps.  I took some Advil right away and then went shopping, so the really terrible feelings didn't last.  I did have cramps for hours after the procedure, so I just kept taking Advil.  I haven't had my first real period since having this put in, so I don't know how heavy it will be or how the cramps will be.  But the experience itself was not pleasant at all.  It better be worth it in the long run!    1  \n",

Doctor started me on the amitrip a week ago so far i like it i also take celexa in the morning in combinatioin but the celexa 40mg isnt helping my anxiety started at 10mg worked my way up. I am 23 have told my doctor that I have been on xanax and klonipin for my PTSD and anxiety and it helped but he wants to explore more options before he gives me an addictive drug.

OSO on how he cured her from herpes disease. And she also gave the email address of this man and advise anybody to contact him for help for any kind of sickness that he would be of help, so I emailed him telling him about my (HERPES) he told me not to worry that i was going to be cured!!

OSO assured me that i will be cured,after some time i went to my doctor to confirmed if i have be finally healed behold it was TRUE,the test came out negative.

       "I've had Genital Herpes problem over 1year and. I tried everything, of course I went to the hospital in other to see the doctor. about a hundred times, probably not that many, but it sure seems like it. It never did any good for long and caused all kinds of other issues having to do with taking too many antibiotics.

       "My name is Alina Gunter am from germany , Hamburg i wonder why people still believe that there is no cure for Genital Herpes simplex virus, I was diagnosed of this virus and tried everything I could but was never cured.

       "Its a miracle that I am alive today. I encounter HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS (HSV1/2) for good four (4) years, six (6) months and twelve (12) day with my calculations, before I meet the great Dr. Emmanuel. I am Tina Richard from Fresno California, united state of America and I was affected with herpes virus.Herpes is a viral infection cause by the Herpes simplex virus, marked by painful, watery blister in the skin or mucous membrane or on the genitals. This was what I suffered for good four years. I have visited CVS Pharmacy in Fresno for treatment but no improvement. I meet Dr.Emmanuel online while I was searching for herpes cure I read a testimony about his work. I give a try that now becomes a testimony in my life.

       "Natural herbs have cured so many illness that drugs and injection cant cure. I've seen the great importance of natural herbs and the wonderful work they have done in people's lives. i read people's testimonies online on how they were cured of Genital warts, hepatitis , diabetics etc by Dr Aluta herbal medicine, so i decided to contact the doctor because i know nature has the power to heal anything. I was diagnosed with Genital  herpes  for the past 2 years but Dr  Aluta cured me with his herbs and i referred my aunt and her husband to him immediately because they were both suffering from Genital herpes but to God be the glory, they were cured too .I know is hard to believe but am a living testimony. There is no harm trying herbs. He is also a spell caster, he cast spell to restore broken marriages and he cast good luck spells to prosper and excel in life. contact Dr Aluta now on email...

(lowered my bmi quite a bit)  No side effects noticed.  it (or the Forskolin) does seem to boost the metabolism and energy (i also exercise 30mins a day at Curves) It seems to melt the fat as i definately sweat more when i work out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    27 \n",

      "I took this in the hope that it would improve my energy level, which has been low despite the fact that I eat a very healthy diet and exercise vigorously every day.  My blood pressure has historically been normal or on the low size.  After several weeks of taking this drug my blood pressure and pulse skyrocketed to level 2 hypertension.

      "I have been able to get off of a long time use of antidepressants using 5 htp. This has been life changing for me. I was depressed on the meds. Now I am getting well. I had actually been diagnosed with M S! I had so many side effects from the meds. Don't give up. The detox from the anti depressants was hard, but 5 htp helped tremendously. I am clear headed, no more brain fog, dizziness, dropping things, falling. The list is long. I also am losing weight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  27 \n",

      "This is a very early review, but my results have been so special I wanted to share my first impressions: I suffer from severe anxiety and have for decades. Sleep quality as tested four times with polysomnogram was terrible. I finally started taking Ambien a few months ago and it really di help, but I'm seeing a pain mgt. doc now for a different problem and he knows how important good quality sleep is for dealing with pain. He doesn't like what Ambien does \"to my patients' thinking\" so switched me to 300mgs Trileptal at night. I have only taken five doses and after the just the fourth night I found my anxiety levels to be lower than they have been in five years! (I had a life-changing sleep disturbance on July 17, 2007...sleep hasn't been the same since). I am so pleased, and no side effects when I wake up. Needless to say, five doses is not enough to convince me, but I will write a follow-up comment in a few months. Also, my appetite is dramatically reduced...so pleased, I've gained 80 pounds in the last ten years...anxiety eating.

      "Well I am very new at taking this med. I am on the fourth day. The first 3 days I had nausea, diahrea, slight headaches, and a very bad case of restless leg syndrome. I swear I could have run a marathon with no effort at all the way my legs were twitching. Last night and today, the 4th day, I feel awsome. No sickness or any of the inital symptoms. Like alot of people say, I feel a cloud lifting and am in a better mood. Its onl 4 days, how good am I going to feel after 4 weeks? The only thing that I am very nervous about is the withdraw once I get my life setteled and I no longer need this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1  \n",
      "I suffer from HepC and a major side effect of the virus is insomnia & depression obviously from sleep depravation. This drug is the only one to date ive found that finally allows me to sleep at least 6hrs. Without it i can go as long as 5 days with no sleep leading to bouts of suicidal feelings out of hopelessness & fatigue. Its two downsides are its not good for my liver & one gets used to it very quickly leading to a necessary increase to still sleep.

      "Was given a sample pack of 250mg tablets months ago and was too scared to take them. I have rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and sjogren's which leaves me extremely fatigued.  Was sleeping all the time, napping all day, falling asleep at work and while driving.  Finally worked up the courage to take half of a pill today and I feel like a new woman.  Put in a full day of work, did laundry, cooked dinner, cleaned, and even baked two loaves of banana bread..all with no three hour nap in the middle of the day.  I don't feel jittery or weird at all, just awake and alert.  I'm going to stick with taking half a pill as i am concerned that a full 250mg may keep me \"up\" too long, but will discuss with dr.  This drug could potentially change my life since i feel up to interacting with my family, playing with the kids, etc.  Instead of, \"mommy's sleeping on the couch again.\"  I am optimistic!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1  \n",

      "Prescribed for sciatic and leg issues at night and have been on it for 3 years.  Dr. Said it was the best of the worst including Lyricia.  No difficulty until dose increased from 300 to 900 daily after 2 years and then not sure if it was because the pharmacy changed suppliers and they said it should not be an issue.  Extreme dizziness, rapid eye movement, brain fog, memory problems and clumsiness. Even on 1 pill a day, 1/2 glass of wine made me intoxicated.  I did research on side affects and was shocked that this is being pushed as a medicine with no or few side affects.  The list of interaction with other drugs is HUGE especially if you are anticipating surgery.   I'm on a titration schedule and hopefully be off it within another week.  From what I read the side affects may last for weeks or even months.  I will stick with Advil and pain patches.

      "I was diagnosed w/ IC 5 years ago.  This is my second time taking Elmiron.  The first time it worked wonders, of course you must follow the diet as well.  After having my son, I started having major flare ups so I started on it again, hasn't worked as well this time have been on it for 5 months.  But I haven't been as strict w/ the diet either.  My advise to others w/ IC is don't give up,  it's hard to have a \"normal\" life, expecially sex, but it can be done. You need to have a lot of communication w/ your partner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1  \n",
      "I read a few of these reviews where people were getting dry mouth as a side effect and getting bad breath. I go to school for dental hygiene and I thought maybe I could suggest some information that would help a few people with this problem. I am also taking this medication and experiencing the dry mouth. The bad breath is from bacteria because there is not as much saliva being produced in your mouth to remove or neutralize the acid. There is bacteria in your mouth and when you eat, the bacteria and the sugars combine and create an acid. There is an \"acid attack\" in your mouth after everytime you eat or drink(besides water). It takes approx. 20 min. for saliva to neuralize an acid attack. With out as much saliva in your mouth it has a harder time neutralizing the acid which in turn there is more bacteria causing the bad breath. Some things that can help are sipping on water, biotene which is a product that helps lubricate/moisten the mouth(can be found at retail stores). Another thing you can do is chew SUGAR FREE gum with an ingredient called xylitol in it for about 5-10min after everytime you eat. The xylitol should be listed in the first three ingredients (gum that has xylitol examples: icebreakers cubes and trident but check the label there are other brands with it as well). Chewing gum with xylitol helps produce more saliva and neutrelizes the acid quicker than 20min. which reduces the bacteria. Xylitol also reduces plaque and tarter which in return helps reduce the chance of cavities. This along with good oral hygiene(brushing 2X's per day for 2 minutes each time and flossing 1X per day). I hope this helps.    1  \n",

      "I have been taking 100mg of zoloft and .5mg of klonopin since February 2008. I see a psychiatrist who monitors my meds and I see a therapist who is helping me with coping skills. I still do have panic attacks but they are no where near as bad before I took the medicine. What I don't like is I have no sex drive, I eat more and I have diarriah.
